Case Study 12

Given the following paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4735.pdf

Build a replica Neural Network with the paper’s architecture using Tensorflow.  If possible begin to train on the data located here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS.  How close can you get to the original results?
To facilitate quicker training you may increase the batch size temporarily (this has a small impact on final result, but can speed you calculations significantly).  You do not need to train a final result using the paper’s parameters, only the code for your model is required in your final submission.

Include in your report:
Based on the class notes and discussion suggest improvements to the procedure.  What are standard practices now versus when this paper was written?  What kind of improvements do they provide?
How would you quantify if your result duplicated the paper’s?
